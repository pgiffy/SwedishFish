# SwedishFish
This was created during the 2018 summer REU ad MSU.
I was working with Dan Wood from Michigan Tech.

This program is the implementation of several algorithms to reconstruct RNA sequences.

There is the SwedishFish algorithm which focuses on breaking down the graph to its simplest form and taking a cut of the graph to pick edges.

There is also a greedy edge removal algorithm that focuses on removing the most edges possible during edge removal.

The program in its current state will run these algorithms and greedy width so they can be compared.

The data being used is based on the Salmon and Flux papers that generate synthetic versions of RNA data for different animals.

The data can be found at here: https://cmu.app.box.com/s/p687exyr279wny7fb2rb36wifvavvu3f

This data was borrowed from an algorithm called catfish. We were tasked with beating catfish, so we are using identical data sets so comparison will be unbiased.

A poster on this was presented at MSU, and a paper will most likely be written in the near future.
